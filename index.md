<p>I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. My research aims to design better machine learning tools for (sequential) data-driven decision making based on <b>data collaboration</b>. </p>

<p>I am advised by Professor <a href="https://hamsabastani.github.io"> Hamsa Bastani</a>. Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics, and the University of Chicago with a M.S. in Statistics. </p>
