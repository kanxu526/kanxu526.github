<p>I am currently an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">Arizona State University W. P. Carey School of Business</a>. Previously, I completed my PhD degree from University of Pennsylvania Department of Economics under the supervision of <a href="https://hamsabastani.github.io"> Hamsa Bastani</a>. I received a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Tsinghua University, and a M.S. in Statistics from University of Chicago. </p>

<p>My research aims to develop novel machine learning algorithms for data-driven decision making practices, with focus on bandits, multitask learning, and high dimensional statistics. In addition, I also seek to provide safe and robust machine learning solutions. My work has been motivated by real-world business applications in healthcare operations, textual analytics, and dynamic pricing. </p>

<p>
I am actively looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students, and colleague collaborators who might be interested in theoretical and applied machine learning. Please feel free to send me an email if you would like to collaborate or chat!

<p>
I will be presenting two works at <a href="https://ide.mit.edu/events/2023-conference-on-digital-experimentation-mit-codemit/">MIT@CODE<a>, Nov 10 - 11, 2023:
<ol>
<li>Session F: Bipartite Experiments, "Online Learning in Matching Market through Matrix Completion"</li>
<li>Session I: Bandits and Adaptive Experimentation, "Learning Across a Network of Bandits"</li>
</ol>
