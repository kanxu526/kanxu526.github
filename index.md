I am currently a 3rd year PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are primarily in transfer learning, bandit algorithm, and econometrics. I am advised by Professor [Hamsa Bastani](https://hamsabastani.github.io/). Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics, and the University of Chicago with a M.S. in Statistics.
