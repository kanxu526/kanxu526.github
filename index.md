I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the Department of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. My research interests are primarily in developing new machine learning algorithms for (sequential) decision making based on <strong>data collaboration</strong>. I am advised by Professor [Hamsa Bastani](https://hamsabastani.github.io/). Previously, I graduated from Tsinghua University with a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics, and the University of Chicago with a M.S. in Statistics.
